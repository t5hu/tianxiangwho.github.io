	  I started out in the natural sciences. My main focus in college was on organic chemistry, but I was interested in everything. I eventually realized that studying statistics would let me, as Tukey said, <a href="https://nationalmedals.org/laureate/john-wilder-tukey/">play in everyone’s backyard</a>. So now I am a statistician, and I'm interested in both the process of applying statistics to science, particularly to biology and genomics, and the theoretical nature of large-scale statistical inference.
	  
	  <p>
	    An obvious practical difficulty is that biological questions are explanatory in nature, asking how and why things are the way they are, but statistics is for the most part descriptive. I am interested in developing analysis patterns for genomic data that bridge the gap between description and explanation. I'm currently focused on spatial transcriptomics and behavioral genomics, and I've also worked on:

	    <ul>
	      <li>
		Zhu, H., Zhao, S.D., Ray, A., Zhang, Y., and Li, X. (2022).<br>
		A comprehensive temporal patterning gene network in Drosophila medulla neuroblasts revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing.<br>
		<em>Nature Communications</em>, 13, 1247.
	      </li>
	      
 	      <li>
		Avalos, A., Fang, M., Pan, H., Lluch, A. R., Lipka, A. E., Zhao, S. D., Giray, T., Robinson, G. E., Zhang, G., and Hudson, M. E. (2020).<br>
		Genomic regions influencing aggressive behavior in honey bees are defined by colony allele frequencies.<br>
		<em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> 117, 17135&ndash;17141.
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    A hallmark of genomics research is that it asks a huge number of biological questions simultaneously, made possible by high-throughput technology. But more questions also leads to more inductive uncertainty. I am interested in understanding the fundamental statistical principles that make it possible to reduce this uncertainty. I'm currently studying empirical Bayesian inference and mediation analysis.

	      <li>
		Zhou*, R. R., Wang, L., and Zhao, S. D. (2020).<br>
		Estimation and inference for the indirect effect in high-dimensional linear mediation models.<br>
		<em>Biometrika</em> 107, 573&ndash;589.<br>
		(<i>An earlier version of this paper was a winner of a 2018 American Statistical Association Section of Statistics in Genomics and Genetics distinguished student paper award.</i>)
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	      
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Finally, I am interested in developing new statistical inference procedures. My <a href="publications.html">work includes</a> multiple hypothesis testing, precision matrix estimation, and high-dimensional survival analysis methods.
