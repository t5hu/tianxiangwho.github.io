	    My interests lay in both the theoretical nature and applications of Prob/Stats/ML, especially in Biomedical Informatics & Bioinformatics(synonym: Genomic Data Science, Computational Genomics, Statistical Genomics). Formulating a problem in the probabilistic/statistical language and then iteratively designing frameworks through experiments seems to be a fun job to me. <p>

	    <b>Prob/Stats/ML</b>: I'm interested in probabilistic and statistical modeling for centralized, decentralized and other possible combined learning frameworks. I'm also interested in domain adaptation.

	    <b>Bioinformatics</b>: In the past decade, the development of single-cell DNA, RNA, and protein measurement technologies allow the study of biology at an unprecedented scale and resolution. Inspired by the possible insights beneficial to human health from the rapidly growing genomic data, and thanks to high-quality MOOCs, I was able to quickly catch up genomics background knowledge as well as its contact points with data science. The following are relevant research experiences.

		Cell Trajectory Inference From Time-course Lineage-traced ScRNA-seq Data Sets <br>
		A challenge in stem cell biology is to associate molecular differences among pregenitor cells with their capacity to generate mature cells with certain cell annotations. We are developing methods to leverage time-course scRNA-seq data sets with lineage tracing information to get better cell trajectory inference, leading to better understanding as well as prediction of cell differentiation. <br>

	    <b>Biomedical Informatics</b>: In practice, medical images and text health records are used together to give diagnosis for patients. I'm interested in the development of efficient and hopefully explainable deep learning methods, which may involve with CV/NLP/Multi-modal models, to mimic and assist the this procedure. The following are relevant research experiences.

		Tooth Segmentation in CBCT Images <br>
		In computer-assisted orthodontics, three-dimensional tooth models are required for many medical treatments. Tooth segmentation from CBCT images is a crucial step in constructing the models. We recognize the task as 2D semantic segmentation and propose an image-quality robust and teeth structure constrained segmentation method. We show that our method obtains better segmentation results on tooth datasets than the other six advanced medical image segmentation methods. <br>

		Transfer Learning for Medical Visual Question Answering <br>
		Recent large-scale pretrained models, such as the CLIP, exhibit an impressive performance on zero-shot and few-shot tasks. We intend to develop methods to efficiently transfer the rich knowledge learned by such models to attain improvements in Medical Visual Question Answering tasks. <br>

		Computer Vision Aided Defects Detection in Additively Manufactured Parts <br>
		Qualifying an AM part is sometimes challenging for internal defects. Computed tomography has been extensively used to study such AM parts. We formulate the qualification as a hypothesis-testing-like procedure, and use ResNet models for slice-wise CT image feature extraction in our qualification pipeline. Our design achieves high accuracy in slice-wise and part-wise qualifications. The scalability of our method is also explored. <br>
