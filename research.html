	  I like probability & statistics and more generally mathematics for two reasons: (1) It is such a language that describes phenomena in an elegant way. I’d like to gain the maturity of reading and writing in mathematics, and thus be able to communicate in the mathematical community full of abstraction, analysis and imagination about the real world. (2) It is a powerful tool used in academic as well as industrial fields, allowing me to play in everyone’s backyard. Machine learning, giving computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed, has been applied in numerous areas in the past decade. Expressing a problem in statistical language and designing frameworks based on experiment analysis and intuition seems to be a fun job to me. My interests lie in both the theoretical nature and applications of Prob/Stats/ML, especially in Biomedical Informatics & Bioinformatics(synonym: Genomic Data Science, Computational Genomics, Statistical Genomics).

	    <b>Bioinformatics</b>: In the past decade, the development of single-cell DNA, RNA, and protein measurement technologies allow the study of biology at an unprecedented scale and resolution. Inspired by the possible insights beneficial to human health from the rapidly growing genomic data, and thanks to high-quality MOOCs, I was able to quickly catch up genomics background knowledge as well as its contact points with data science. I have completed the Genomic Data Science Specialization launched by Johns Hopkins University including (1) Introduction to Genomic Technologies, (2) Python for Genomic Data Science, (3) Algorithms for DNA Sequencing, (4) Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science, (5) Bioconductor for Genomic Data Science and (6) Statistics for Genomic Data Science. The following are relevant research experiences.

	    <b>Biomedical Informatics</b>: I'm interested in analysis of CT data sets etc. The following are relevant research experiences.
	    <ul>
	      <li>
		Xxxxx on medical CT images 2 <br>
		Given xxx, predict xxx blablabla xxxxx xxxxx<br>
		(In Submission)

          <p>
	    <b>Others</b>: I'm open to collaboration in other fields. The following are some examples.
	    <ul>
 	      <li>
		Computer Vision Aided Defects Detection in Additively Manufactured Parts <br>
		Qualifying an AM part is sometimes challenging for internal defects. Computed tomography has been extensively used to study such AM parts. We formulate the qualification as a hypothesis-testing-like procedure, and use ResNet models for slice-wise CT image classifications in our qualification pipeline. Our design achieves high accuracy in slice-wise and part-wise qualifications. The scalability of our method is also explored. <br>
