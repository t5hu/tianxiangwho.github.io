		Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.<br>

		The purpose of mathematics really is to communicate ideas and concepts in a very precise way, and to strip out the essence of what is the real problem at hand. // If you have a mathematical mindset, you can gain some confidence that something you don’t understand, like how a cell phone works or how computer works or how the internet works or how an economy works, it gives you enough tools that you can feel like if you really had to, you can actually understand from first principles, how these things actually work, and the world somehow becomes a less scary place.<br>

		Definitions are like vocabulary, theorems like grammar, examples like reading and listening, and solving problems like speaking. If you are only exposed to a limited selection of phrases and learn to repeat them but do not know much vocabulary and grammar, your conversations will be very limited. If you only learn grammar and vocabulary but do not practice much, you will also not be able to communicate well. One needs to do all of the above, which requires time, dedication, and hard work. But the benefits, particularly when math is concerned, are definitely worth it!<br>

		Learn to say “Fuck You” to the world once in a while. You have every right to.

		Feeling theories matters, through which we refine and reshape, and forge a robust intuition. This intuition empowers ones imagination and serves as a bridge connecting one with the real world. It unlocks a wellspring of creativity, fostering a more profound mode of thinking and/or paving the way for innovative applications.<br>

		If I ask you about art, you'd probably give me the skinny on every art book ever written. Michelangelo, you know a lot about him, life's work, political aspirations, him and the pope, sexual orientations, the whole works, right? But I'll bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.<br>
